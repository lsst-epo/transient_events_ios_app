<h2>What is the Bookmark List?</h2>
<p>
Bookmarks are events which you have saved because you think they are interesting.  Bookmarks are different from items shown on the event page because they are stored on your device.  This is useful if you are out in the field at a telescope where you do not have access to the internet.  
</p>

<h2>What do the colors mean?</h2>
<p>
The colors indicate the visibility of the object from the location and minimum altitude which are set in the Settings screen.  Green means that the object is currently visible.  Yellow means that the object is currently below the minimum altitude but will exceed that altitude at some later time.  Red means that this object never gets above the minimum altitude at this location.
</p>

<h2>How do I see more information?</h2>
<p>
If want to see more information about an event simply touch the event.  Touching the event will take you to a page containing more detailed information about the event as well as a series of images.  The images show the original reference images and typically 4 of the new images which caused the event to be issued. The first image you see will be the first new image.  The reference image is to the left (swipe to the right) and the other three new images are to the right (swipe to the left).</p> 
<p>
If you want to view this object in your telescope a finder chart is available by touching the "Finder Chart" button. 
</p>

<h2>How do I get rid of old bookmarks?</h2>
<p>
If you want to delete bookmarks you can press the Edit button and select the items you wish to delete  by touching the red minus sign and pressing the Delete button or by swiping right to left on the item and then pressing the Delete button.
</p>

<h2>I am in the field and I cannot see the Finder Chart!</h2>
<p>
We are working on this.  At the present time the Finder Charts are web pages with links to images and it is not possible to download the page and all of the links.
