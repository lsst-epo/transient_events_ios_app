Gravitational microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. This effect occurs only when the two stars are almost exactly aligned. If the foreground lensing star has a planet, then that planet's own gravitational field can make a detectable contribution to the lensing effect.
