Mira variables, named after the star Mira, are a class of pulsating variable stars characterized by very red colors, pulsation periods longer than 100 days, and light amplitudes greater than one magnitude in infrared and 2.5 magnitude in visual. They are red giant stars in the very late stages of stellar evolution (the asymptotic giant branch) that will expel their outer envelopes as planetary nebulae and become white dwarfs within a few million years.
