A luminosity enhancement in the light curve of a galaxy observed in X-rays or ultraviolet surveys supposed to be associated with the tidal disruption of a star that has passed close to a supermassive black hole in the core of a host galaxy. An accretion disk forms after the tidal disruption. The flare event marks the beginning of the accretion process onto the black hole.
