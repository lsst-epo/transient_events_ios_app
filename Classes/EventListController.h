 @brief Downloads and displays event table view
 
 The event list controller handles the Events tab on the tab bar.  This is the first
 page which comes up when the app is first launched.  The EventListController creates
 a POST request based on the values of the settings which are stored in user defaults.
 This POST request is sent to the server.  The server then returns a JSON formatted 
 response string which is parsed and the individual events are put into an array which 
 is then used to populate the table.  The thumbnail images which are also displayed in the
 table are queued up and downloaded in the background.  When an event is touch
 the EventListController loads a detail view controller and hands off control to the detail
 controller by pushing it onto the top of the navigation controller stack.
 
 There is a reasonable amount if intelligence in determining if the data needs to be 
 reloaded from the server.  If you go to the detail controller and then back there
 is no need to reload.  If you change a setting it is the responsibility of the setting 
 controller to send either a kRefreshNotification or a kReloadNotification to tell the
 EventList controller whether it needs to reload the data or just refresh the table view.
 
 I have tested this with very large amount of downloaded data on a first gen iPod Touch without
 encountering memory issues.  Just in case, if a memory warning is issued the image cache is 
 cleared of all images.  They then reload when needed.
 
 This object does not use CoreData for storage, just a simple array store.  This is different 
 from the BookMarkListController which uses CoreData.  Perhaps someday this can be changed.
