<h1>Settings Help</h1>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>
The location setting allows you to set the location for observing.  Normally you would set your current location by pressing the button in the lower left of the screen.  This will acquire your location from the device using either GPS, Phone Tower locations or your wireless access point.  The location will be shown on a map.  If you are using an iPhone, the location accuracy will refine itself with time as the GPS gets information from the satellites.  The GPS coordinates will also be used to determine the name of of the town/city where you are located, this information will be displayed as the name of the location.  If you would like a more descriptive name like "My House", you can edit the text.
</p>

<p>
If you like you can press the "+" button and save this location to the Location list for use at a another time.
</p>

<p>
If you are in a location where Location Services does not work or you want to enter an alternate location you can type in the longitude and latitude values directly.  You can also touch the Locations button at the top right and select from the list of observatories and saved locations.
</p>

<h1>Filter Settings</h1>
<p>
Filter settings allow you to determine which events are displayed and how the information is presented.  Except for the RA Format, non of these settings affect the display of Bookmarked events.
</p>



<h2>Magnitude Limit</h2>
<p>
The magnitude limit sets the maximum magnitude objects to display.  Only objects brighter than the set value will be downloaded and displayed in the event list.
</p>

<h2>Event Types</h2>
<p>
Select the types of events which are of interest.  Only the checked event types will be downloaded from the server and displayed in the event list.
</p>

<h2>Event Age</h2>
<p>
Event Age allows you to specify the maximum age of the events presented in the list. 
</p> 


<h2>Minimum Elevation</h2>
<p>
Objects below the minimum elevation are not considered visible.  The default value is 0û (the horizon) but if you are in a valley and cannot see the horizon or if you never want to observe objects which are below a certain elevation you can set this to a higher number.
</p>

<h2>RA-DEC Format</h2>
<p>
This allows the select of the display for RA and DEC to either decimal degrees or hours:min:sec (RA) and deg:min:sec (DEC)
</p>

<h2>Visible Objects Only</h2>
<p>
Turning this switch on will cause the event list to only display objects which are currently visible based on your location and minimum elevation settings
</p>

<h1>Notifications</h1>
<p>
When Notifications are enabled your filter event types and magnitude information are sent to the server and anytime an event which meets this criteria is entered into the event database your device will receive a notification.  When a notification is received and you open the application, Transient Events will highlight the event with a flashing ALERT logo.
